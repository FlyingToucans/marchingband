    States and Nationals yearly. Our chapter is run by Miss Long and Mr. Marron, engineering teacher with TSA experience. 
    Join our STEM TSA Chapter for success and fun!

<h5> STEM Chapter History </h5>
<h4> We have a lot of students going to states and nationals and they have placed very well. 
     Last year, we had freshmen teams place 5th at Nationals and they loved everything about the process. We always look for new people to
     join and many times, through TSA, students can pursue their goals. Many of our chapter teams have done TSA from 9th grade to 12th and
     have went to States and Nationals each time. STEM TSA has a rich history and a lot of our students have the opportunity to pursue their dreams. Our chapter has placed first in States in Biotechnoloy and Engineering Design. We also placed in Promotional Design, CAD Architecture, and we have won the Pennsylvania Inspiration Award for our chapter at States. We have qualified for Nationals many times!

<h5> STEM Academy TSA Leadership and Community Service Projects </h5>
<h4> 
During the TSA season, the Downingtown STEM Academy TSA does many leadership and community service projects during school and outside of school. We have raised money for our district’s Technology and Engineering Departments by selling safety goggles in the high schools. We promote the Technology and Engineering Departments and give out many surveys to our students to improve the courses of these subjects. A picture of one of the posts on our school’s social board is below.

We also raise money for our chapter and regional/state competition fees by fundraising. One of our tickets for Buffalo Wild Wings is shown below.

<h4>	
	Also, much of our chapter is dedicated to robotics and technology. We have many teams in PA Robotics Competitions for FRC and VEX. Our chapter’s students have been judging and volunteering at robotics competitions for the past several years. Currently, one of our teams, 91A, is in the top 50 in the world! Our chapter teams have also split up and done community service at hospitals, museums, and libraries. Our chapter participates in many leadership and community service opportunities that the school offers as well, and we always have fun!
