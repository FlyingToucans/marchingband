<h3>
Communications Technology (Grades 9/10) 
Meets 4 periods of the 6-day cycle
.66 Credit
</h3>
<h4>
This course provides an in-depth look into communication technologies and processes and requires students to create 
and use technology effectively and to creatively communicate through a variety of avenues.  The course also exposes students
to digital communications, digital photography, webpage design, video technologies, editing software, and advertising. 
The course provides a hands-on introduction to many forms of software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, C#, Java, 
iMovie, Final Cut Pro, and more.

<h4>
IB Computer science(Years 1 & 2) involves solving problems using computers. Therefore a full understanding of logical problem solving 
is required as well as detailed knowledge of how computers operate. Successful computerized systems result from a clear
understanding of the problem to be solved; appropriate use of hardware based on a detailed knowledge of its capabilities 
and limitations; efficient use of algorithms and data structures; thorough and logical design; careful testing and 
integration of all these components. Students of IB Computer sSience will be guided by problem-solving
strategies that will be continually reinforced in their coursework.  Initial stages of the process will involve identifying 
and defining the problem(s) to be solved using a computerized system. The problem will be broken down (decomposed) 
into parts, with each part requiring a particular solution.  From this problem definition, the student will construct 
appropriate algorithms to create a solution.  The emphasis should be on the use of a logical approach and analytical 
thinking while using a computer to solve problems.

<h4>
Students in IB Computer Science use many different programs on the Dell computers in the computer lab. For a final project in junior year, students will create a box of chocolate, as well as the chocolate itself. They will first brainstorm a sketch and important features about the product. They research colors that appeal to the target audience and other characteristics that suits the product. They will use Autodesk Inventor CAD to design the the wooden piece of the product. Then, they will create an indent in plastic through pressured heat so that they can put the melted chocolate inside. They will also design the net for the packaging. The final product will be given to students in elementary schools to promote the STEM fields in the DASD district.

<h4>
Students in 9th/10th Grade Computer Programming Java learn how to code in the Java language. They learn about variables, constants, loops, if-else statements, documentation, operations, and playgrounds in the Xcode application. They use knowledge from Geometry to create a Triangle-Solver with user interface. There are two user cases. First, if a user inputs the 3 sides of a triangle, the student must write code to find if it is a right triangle and the angles of the triangle. The other case is: If the user inputs 1 side and 2 angles, the student’s program must find the other 2 sides and angle. Students use trigonometric ratios(sin, cos, tan) and the Pythagorean Theorem to write their code.
